#+title: Modded Minecraft Server with Docker Compose
#+author: Emmet

This directory contains:
- [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose.yml]] - This stores information about the Minecraft server container that is needed, and where server data should be stored
- data - This stores the Minecraft server data and is generated when first starting the server
  - data/mods - This is where mods should be placed (if you're using [[https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/][Forge]] or [[https://fabricmc.net/][Fabric]], which seem to be two most popular). Certain mods (especially custom biome mods) /must/ be here /before/ the containers are first started and the world is generated. Adding these mods later can mess with the world generation if the world was generated without them.

** Service Overview
Within the [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose file]], some basic configuration of the Minecraft server can be instanced, namely:
- Minecraft Version
- Minecraft Modloader Type (i.e. [[https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/][Forge]], [[https://fabricmc.net/][Fabric]], etc... full list of available types are listed [[https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types-and-platforms/][here]])
- Minecraft Server Port (if you want something different than the default 25565)
- Memory Limit (RAM Usage) for the Minecraft Server

Other server configuration can be edited directly in the data directory later.

** Setup
For details on how to turn this into a working gameserver, see [[./setup.org][setup.org]].
