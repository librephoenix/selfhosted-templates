#+title: Vanilla Minecraft Server with Docker Compose
#+author: Emmet

This directory contains:
- [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose.yml]] - This stores information about the Minecraft server container that is needed, and where server data should be stored
- data - This stores the Minecraft server data and is generated when first starting the server

** Service Overview
Within the [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose file]], some basic configuration of the Minecraft server can be instanced, namely:
- Minecraft Version
- Minecraft Server Port (if you want something different than the default 25565)
- Memory Limit (RAM Usage) for the Minecraft Server

Other server configuration can be edited directly in the data directory later.

** Setup
For details on how to turn this into a working gameserver, see [[./setup.org][setup.org]].

** Maintenance
For more details on maintaining this gameserver, see [[./maintenance.org][maintenance.org]].
