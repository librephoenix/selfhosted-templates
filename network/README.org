#+title: Network Docker Compose
#+author: Emmet

This directory contains:
- [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose.yml]] - This stores information about what containers are needed, how those containers are connected, and where data should be stored
- data - Once all of the docker containers referenced in the compose file are started, persistent storage is created here

** Service Overview
Within the [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose file]], just two services are started:
- [[https://www.wireguard.com/][Wiregaurd]] - So I can VPN into my house if necessary
- [[https://pi-hole.net/][Pi-hole]] - Network-level adblock and custom DNS!

** Setup
For details on how to turn this into a working production environment, see [[./setup.org][setup.org]].

** Maintenance
For more details on maintaining this environment, see [[./maintenance.org][maintenance.org]].
