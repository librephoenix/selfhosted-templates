#+title: Network Docker Compose
#+author: Emmet

This directory contains:
- [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose.yml]] - This stores information about what containers are needed, how those containers are connected, and where data should be stored
- data - Once all of the docker containers referenced in the compose file are started, persistent storage is created here

** Service Overview
Within the [[./docker-compose.yml][docker-compose file]], just two services are started:
- [[https://www.wireguard.com/][Wiregaurd]] - So I can VPN into my house if necessary
- [[https://pi-hole.net/][Pi-hole]] - Network-level adblock and custom DNS!

** Pi-hole Setup
[[https://pi-hole.net/][Pi-hole]] is a network-level adblock and custom DNS server for your network! The adblocking capabilities can save you a lot of bandwidth, and it can even be configured to allow safe browsing for your kids (block gambling, chat, social and porn sites). For details on how to turn this into a working production environment, see [[./pi-hole-setup.org][pi-hole-setup.org]].

** Wireguard Setup
- [[https://www.wireguard.com/][Wiregaurd]] is a modern, lightweight and secure VPN protocol. If setting this up on a home network, you can use this to VPN into your home network to control local devices while away. For details on how to set this up, see [[./wireguard-setup.org][wireguard-setup.org]].

** Maintenance
For more details on maintaining this environment, see [[./maintenance.org][maintenance.org]].
